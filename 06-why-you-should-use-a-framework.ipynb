We'll use fastai and PyTorch. The benefits of using these libraries is:\n\n- Best practices are handled for you automatically -- fast.ai has done thousands of hours of experiments to figure out what the best settings are for you\n- Less time getting set up, which means more time to try out your new ideas\n- Each idea you try will be less work, because fastai and PyTorch will do the many of the menial bits for you\n- You can always drop down from fastai to PyTorch if you need to customise any part (or drop down from the fastai Application API to the fastai mid or low tier APIs), or even drop down from PyTorch to plain python for deep customisation.\n\nLet's see how that looks in practice.
